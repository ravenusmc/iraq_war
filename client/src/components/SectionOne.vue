        <h1>About this Project</h1>
        <p>
          I served in the Iraq war from August of 2006 until March of 2007 as a
          U.S. Marine. I was stationed at Camp Fallujah running convoys into the
          city of Fallujah supporting the Marines there. I've been meaning to do
          a project about the Iraq war for quite some time now. I finally found a
          dataset on Kaggle that will allow me to do this.
